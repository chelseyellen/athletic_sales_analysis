# athletic_sales_analysis
## Introduction
This class challenge was to work with pandas to review and manipulate data. This challenge worked through:
* Create a repository in GitHub
* Importing CSVs
* Concatonating data via rows
* Look for null vaues
* Work with groupby
* Work with pivot tables
* Filtering data
* Resampling data

## Results
This was an excellent exercise. I was challenged and then the additional problems led to more practice on the rinitial challenge questions which helped drive home exactly how to manipulate the data with groupby or pivot tables. I was uncertain why we would do one over the other, but my tutor Nomsa provided an excellent overview on the use cases for each.
